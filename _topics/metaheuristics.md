Metaheuristics aim to generate or select a heuristic for an optimization problem,
particularly where the set of sample solutions is too large to completely sample.

A handful of metaheuristic crates exists in the Rust ecosystem, most notably
several libraries that make it straight-forward to write genetic or evolutionary algorithms.
